- Since it is a derivative of the original 2048, it is not the same. Specifically, it has the following additions:

- Three board sizes: 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5. The smaller the board is, the fewer cells you have, and the harder the game is.

- Three game modes: The original Power of 2, i.e. combining two tiles of the same value to produce their sum. The Power of 3, i.e. combining three consecutive tiles of the same value to produce their sum. Not surprisingly, this is pretty hard with the 3x3 board, although I found it pretty easy to get 81. 243 is a different story... And the Fibonacci sequence, i.e. combining two adjacent numbers in the sequence 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (I omitted the two 1's in the beginning) to produce the one next to the larger value. This is pretty tricky. Try it out and you will know what I mean.

- Three themes: I made a bright theme and a 'joyful' theme in addition to the original one. In case you wonder how to do themes in iOS. (There may be a better way, but themes are verbose in nature, because you have to specify all the colors, fonts, etc.)
